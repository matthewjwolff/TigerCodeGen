## Project Status
To be honest, I dropped the ball kinda low on this one. We have a very minimal munch algorithm implemented. SPIM seems to reject a lot of code since it creates a lot of "add $v0 $v0" instructions. I'm working on fixing that, but that instruction only seems to appear after register allocation. Might not fix it in time to submit.
